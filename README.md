# ScaledBernoulli
This repo has code and data related to our work on scaled Bernoulli mixture model applied to cluster single-cell ATAC-seq data. 

## Synthetic data: 
The uploaded archive for synthetic data is a csv file, unzip it before running. In the CSV file, peaks are in the rows and cells are in the columns.   


TSNE coordinates for synthetic data are provided in Data folder. Also provided the clustering labels for this data using FlexMix package.
